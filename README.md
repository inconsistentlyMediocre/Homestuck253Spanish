# Homestuck253Spanish
Homestuck "[S] YOU THERE. BOY." walkaround translated to Spanish made in the Godot Engine.

You can use this as a base for your own translations. For the time being, the text is hardcoded, but I'll be working on this to have the game read the text from an external file, so it's easier to edit.

This is made in the Godot Engine, so you'll need that in order to edit the game and export it. It's free and open source!. You can get it [here](https://godotengine.org/download)
